# Entrepreneurship II - Product-Market Fit, Scaling, and Investment

## Course Overview

What does it take to move from a validated startup idea, and initial growth, to being a company prepared to raise money and scale?

In Entrepreneurship I we attempted to prove to ourselves that we had **Product-Market Fit**. Now we will try to convince others that we have it. Most of what we will do in this course will be expressed in the form of a **Investor Pitch Deck** that you will create.

**This is not an engineering course.** You will not need to code more than some HTML/CSS, and it is better if you don't code at all and rely on off-the-shelf products like Survey Monkey and Google Drive to run your experiments.
